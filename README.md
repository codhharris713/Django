# Django
Updated Django/Python Project
This is a project I worked on in my free time after work to better understand the Django Framework. It is based off the Python Live Project I worked on at my time in school. It is a CRUD application based around letting users create, retrieve, update, and delete entries into the database.

To store the data I created a model table which will be creating instances through my view.
I then ran the two commands makemigrations and migrate to create the database for the same.

As well as a model form to display the model fields.
